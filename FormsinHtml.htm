<!--  Forms in HTML 
      We are going to learn the forms in html 
	 * How these forms are useful to the webpages ? 
     Ans . whenever we need to take the information from the user  we use the forms . 
  There are three main attributes while creating the form . 
   action -- This attribute allows to send the data of the user to the specified server by the client .   
   Method -- This allows to send the data in the privacy mode and also in the non privacy mode by the key values get and post 
             * If we use the get key value then the information will be sent to the server in the form by adding question mark to the server link and key value pairs . 
			 *  If we use the post key value then the information will be sent the server in the hidden form . 
   target -- This allows to open the successfull/failure/error page in the same webpafe or in the new webpage using the _self and _blank .

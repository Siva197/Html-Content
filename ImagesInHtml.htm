<!--  img tag in html is self closing tag  which is used to attach the images in the html we can;t directly upload the image using the img tag itself . 
     * we have an attribute to specify the path to get the image address known as src (attribute) , and we can specify the dimensions of the images using 
	 * the width and height attributes  . 
	 * Note - We have to specify the full path of the image that we want to attach in the website .  
	 If it is in the same directory and in the same folder then we don't want to specify the full path 
--  We have another attribute alt which is used to display the content whenever the image path is incorrect or image is not found we can customise the content that 
    should be displayed whenever the img is not found -->

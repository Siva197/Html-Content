     We are going to learn Html , Css and also the javascript langugae   
	 What is HTML ? 
	  HTML stands for hyper text markup language  
	  Before going in depth about html we should know what is markup language 
	  We have many programmming languages like c,c++, java , python , etc . 
	  But There is a difference between the markup language and other programming languages 
	  In programming languages we will use the variables,functions but in this markup langugae we are going to use the tags 
	 <-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     what is tag ? 
     * Anything that is kept in the angular brackets is known as tag 
     Eg - <x> -- known as x tag 
         <siva> -- siva tag 
      Terminoligies that are used in the HTML are tag , element and also the attribute 
      
      What is this Element ? 
     * In general for every tag in the html have the start and end tag and the matter that is kept in between the tags is known as element 
    Eg - <siva> This is markup language </siva> 
	
	We will provide an extra information to the tag whenever it is necessary  that additional infromation is known as attribute 
	
   Eg - <myname type = "nickname"> Siva Sai Teja </myname> 
    
	 Here i am writing my name but i am specifying that the name i have given is nickname of mine , it's not the original name

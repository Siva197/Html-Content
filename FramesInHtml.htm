<!-- We are going to learn the Frames in Html 
     This is an deprecated topic we can use this util the  next version of Html arrives .
       
$ What do you mean by the Frames ? 
     * Frames can be used to display the mutliple webpages in a single webpage . 
     * But we have an another disadvantage of using the frames . Frames will be fixed space , it treats as screen as 1s 100% and then we can't see the content . 
	 * It's just like an photo frame . -->

<!--  We can divide the frame into rows and columns , you can divide into many many parts , but i am dividing into three parts -->
<!-- We are not able to see anything in the webpage after dividing it into parts ,
     for that we need create separate files for the divided percentage and want to place in the frame -->
